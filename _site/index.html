      <h3 id="welcome-to-computer-club">Welcome to Computer Club.</h3>

<p>2016 marks the first year of our experimental club. The club’s main goals are to teach real-world programming skills to middle school students, and along the way learn related skills such as animation and video editing, and softer skills like collaboration, storytelling, and if all goes well, public speaking.</p>

<p>Each year will have a unique project that’s fairly ambitious, and we will spend a couple hours each week throughout the school year learning and building. The endgame of the club will be to have a working, demonstrable project, that can be presented in-house at the school in a small ceremony, and possibly at a local tech user’s group or conference, where we will talk about the process and challenges we faced, and give a live demonstration of the final product.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you-what-are-your-qualifications">Who are you? What are your qualifications.</h3>

<p>I’m <a href="mailto:ceautery@gmail.com">Curtis Autery</a>, father to Scout, and will be leading the group the first year. I have been a tech enthusiast since I was a boy, and have been in the professional IT world since 1995. I’m currently a lead software engineer at <a href="https://www.mutuallyhuman.com/">Mutually Human</a>, and demos of my various side projects throughout the years are available on my <a href="http://curtisautery.appspot.com">current</a> and <a href="http://cautery.blogspot.com">previous</a> blogs.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, I volunteered at Tech Corps Ohio, and was placed at a school where I taught their three classes of 5th graders (60 kids total) how to make Excel spreadsheets and Powerpoint slideshows; the school liked my work well enough to invite me back for a second year. Around the same time, I volunteered at my eldest (now 20!) daughter’s elementary school, where I ran a before-school program to help a group of kids plot stock market data to see which grade picked the best stock that year. I’ve done other work with kids, from tutoring a handful of 3rd graders one year, to mentoring a teen boy for many years with Northwest Counseling, and even to a couple of less than stellar soccer seasons here at Clintonville. Um… sorry about that.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-the-club-do-in-the-first-year">What will the club do in the first year?</h3>

<p>The year one project will be creating a web app video game. The game will be simple by modern standards, a side-scroller, or old-school Zelda type adventure. The club members will decide the content of the game, from plot, to artwork, to character backstories and goals.</p>

<p>We will use JavaScript for the game logic, and an HTML5 2D canvas context and the WebAudio API for rendering the action. As the project progresses, we will save game state on a server running Node.js, and if we get to the point where multiplayer is possible, we’ll implement a Websocket connection between the player browsers and the server backend.</p>

<p>Game cutscenes will be hand-drawn using a Wacom Intuos Manga tablet, and character animation will rotoscoped from real-world videos of students performing actions - jump to catch a branch, run and switch direction, etc. An iPhone camera in video mode should suffice for the quality we need, but if anyone has a nicer camera they’d like to loan the group, I wouldn’t turn it down.</p>

<h3 id="can-kids-who-dont-want-to-be-programmers-participate">Can kids who don’t want to be programmers participate?</h3>

<p>Of course! Not everyone will take to functions, objects, lists, and whatnot, but more than the minutiae of syntax and logic goes into a game. It needs a plot. It needs characters and their histories. It needs artwork for cutscenes, and character animations. We need writers and artists, and someone who can work a video camera. So everyone, regardless of their technical aptitude, will have something meaningful to contribute to the project.</p>

<p>On a similar note, women are severely underrepresented in STEM careers, despite being equally qualified. Girls are very welcome in the group, technical aptitude or no, and I suspect you’ll be surprised at how easy programming is to pick up.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-the-club-meet">When will the club meet?</h3>

<p>The group should start meeting sometime in November, once per week after school, from shortly after last bell until around 5. I don’t expect to hold everyone’s attention for two straight hours, especially after a long school day. We’ll talk about the progress so far, introduce a new concept, work on it for a little, take a break, and then split into groups. If your child only has an hour to give before they’re brain-fried and they want to retire to Latchkey or get picked up early, that’s fine. This is supposed to be fun, not a chore.</p>

<p>Outside of the meetings, I’ll be available over email or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/autery">Facebook</a> for questions, to look over code or artwork, at any time.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-see-exactly-what-my-kid-is-working-on">Can I see EXACTLY what my kid is working on?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. One of my main goals is to be completely transparent about club activities. You are welcome to sit in (and learn to program, if that’s interesting to you), and I’d prefer that emails with questions or game content come from the <em><strong>parents’</strong></em> email addresses.</p>

<p>The code in progress will be a project in the <a href="https://github.com/ClintonvilleAcademy">club’s GitHub organization page</a>. Any parent or staff member with a GitHub account can join the project as a collaborator. Just let me know, and I’ll send an invitation.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-cost">What’s the cost?</h3>

<p>For year one, there should be no cost to parents. All the tools we will use are free, and I will commit to cover any event speaking fees this year.</p>

<h3 id="who-can-be-in-the-club-how-many">Who can be in the club? How many?</h3>

<p>Because I want to help the group learn skills that are more sophisticated than you find in the “Hour of Code” project, I’d like to restrict this to just middle school. I think we should cap year one at 10 kids, maybe 12 if there’s a big interest. Any more than that and our meetings will switch from truly collaborating to me lecturing, which sort of defeats the purpose.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Don’t hesitate to send any questions or suggestions my way, and I’m looking forward to working with the group this year.</p>

<p>Curtis</p>
